<p>Short Reflection from the project.</p>

<p>My design is chosen from the <u>colors I like which are purple and blue</u>. The overall of the website is casual and friendly. If I were to develop a peronal website, I would like the website to be friendly to readers as how I am talking to myself. It should be full of remarks that I made daily or in my casual conversation.</p>

<p>The <b>challenges I faced during the website development</b> are the <b>difficulties to follow with the code and the github</b>. It is quite hard for me to follow the lesson as I am very new to the coding world. I have never imagine myself using Visual Code Studio or making a website from scratch. It is a new and challenging experience. I also faced a difficultes during the <b>submission process</b>. I tried to open the website from github to check whehter the link is functioning to submit later. However, <u>the website turned out to be colorless and the images did not appear</u>. The text and division are all good, but the website is problematic from the color and images disappering. The problem is solved with the help of Sir Faizal Haini Fadzil. The problem is that the folder of css and images is not in the github, hence it is not appearing in the website. I managed to upload the folder and the problem is solved. Thank you again to Sir Faizal for the help and support.</p>

<p>The <i>lessons learnt</i> during the development of the website is <i>to stay calm and follow the instruction carefully</i>. I learnt that coding needs details and to make sure everthing goes well, the code has to be correctly written to be understood by the software used. I have learnt a lot about website development and it is very interesting to be doing it myself. It needs focus and knowledge, but it was fun as well.</p>

<p style="color: darkblue;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">A million thank you to Sir Faizal for the knowledge and support during the project.</p>
